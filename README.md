Project idea management for developers

### Description

An app build with test-driven development and clean architecture in Flutter. Allows the user to add project ideas for development. All data is stored locally at the time. However, there will be an option to use Google Firebase for remote data storage as well as Authentication using Google or E-Mail. This will then allow the user to use the Web-Version which will also build using Flutter.
